# owf-app-geoprocessor-python-test Images
Images are used in this repository to explain how to recreate the test data for certain commands. Often times, the test data is created manually with QGIS or ArcDesktop software. The images provide visual resources of buttons that must be clicked in order to recreate the test data. 

The images within this folder are referenced in the `data/README.md` files of certain command folders.

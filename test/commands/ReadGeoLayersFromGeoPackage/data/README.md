The following describes the source of data.

| **File** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| `points-one-layer.gpkg` | Copy of `SplitGeoLayerByAttribute/results/points-split/Group_a.gpkg`.  **This file should be copied to `results` before reading because SQLite changes the files when reading, and want to avoid committing the dynamicly changed copy. |
